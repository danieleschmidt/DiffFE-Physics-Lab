# Balanced features for most use cases
solver = create_enhanced_fem_solver(scaling_level="standard") 

# All features for large-scale problems
solver = create_enhanced_fem_solver(scaling_level="aggressive")

# Auto-detect based on system resources
solver = create_enhanced_fem_solver(scaling_level="auto")
```

### Custom Configurations

```python
scaling_options = {
