## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these guidelines:

### How to Report

**Do NOT create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities through one of these channels:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred)
   - Go to the repository's Security tab
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the private vulnerability report form

2. **Email** (Alternative)
   - Send details to: security@diffhe-physics.org
   - Use PGP key: [Fingerprint: ABC123...] if available
   - Include "[SECURITY]" in the subject line

### What to Include

Please provide as much detail as possible:

- **Vulnerability Description**: Clear description of the security issue
- **Impact Assessment**: Potential impact and severity
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions are affected
- **Reproduction Steps**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
- **Proof of Concept**: Code example demonstrating the vulnerability
- **Suggested Fix**: Any ideas for addressing the issue (optional)
- **Your Contact Info**: How we can reach you for follow-up

### Example Report

```
Subject: [SECURITY] Buffer overflow in mesh parsing

Description:
A buffer overflow exists in the mesh file parser when processing 
malformed .msh files with extremely long element names.

Impact:
Remote code execution when processing untrusted mesh files.

Affected Versions:
All versions prior to 1.2.3

Reproduction:
1. Create malformed mesh file with 10000+ character element name
2. Load using diffhe.mesh.load_mesh("malformed.msh")
3. Process crashes with segmentation fault

Proof of Concept:
[Attached: exploit.py and malformed.msh]

Contact: researcher@university.edu
```

## Response Process

### Timeline

- **24 hours**: Initial acknowledgment of report
- **72 hours**: Preliminary assessment and severity classification
- **1 week**: Detailed analysis and fix development (for high/critical issues)
- **2 weeks**: Security patch release (for high/critical issues)
- **30 days**: Public disclosure (after fix is available)

### Severity Classification

#### Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)
- Remote code execution
- Privilege escalation
- Authentication bypass
- **Response**: Emergency patch within 72 hours

#### High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)
- Data exposure
- Denial of service
- Local privilege escalation
- **Response**: Fix within 1 week

#### Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
- Information disclosure
- Local denial of service
- **Response**: Fix in next minor release

#### Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)
- Minor information leaks
- Low-impact vulnerabilities
- **Response**: Fix in next major release

### Our Commitment

When you report a vulnerability, we commit to:

1. **Acknowledge** your report promptly
2. **Investigate** the issue thoroughly
3. **Keep you informed** of our progress
4. **Credit you** appropriately (if desired)
5. **Fix the issue** in a timely manner
6. **Coordinate disclosure** responsibly

## Security Measures

### Development Practices

- **Code Review**: All code changes require peer review
- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning in CI/CD
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability scans of dependencies
- **Signed Releases**: All releases are cryptographically signed
- **Minimal Dependencies**: We minimize external dependencies

### Input Validation

- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- Mesh files are parsed with bounds checking
- Parameter values are validated against expected ranges
- File operations include path traversal protection

### Memory Safety

- Use of memory-safe languages where possible (Python)
- Bounds checking for array operations
- Careful management of GPU memory allocations
- Protection against buffer overflows in C/C++ extensions

### Cryptographic Security

- Use of well-established cryptographic libraries
- Secure random number generation
- Proper key management for signed releases
- No custom cryptographic implementations

## Common Security Considerations

### Mesh File Security

**Risk**: Malformed mesh files could cause crashes or code execution

**Mitigation**:
- Validate mesh file format before processing
- Implement size limits on mesh elements
- Use safe parsing libraries with bounds checking
- Sandbox mesh processing when possible

### Computational Security

**Risk**: Malicious input parameters could cause excessive resource usage

**Mitigation**:
- Implement timeouts for long-running computations
- Validate parameter ranges and mesh sizes
- Monitor memory and GPU usage
- Provide resource limit configuration options

### Dependency Security

**Risk**: Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies

**Mitigation**:
- Regular security updates for all dependencies
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Minimal dependency footprint
- Pin specific dependency versions in releases

### Data Protection

**Risk**: Sensitive simulation data exposure

**Mitigation**:
- No automatic data transmission to external services
- Secure temporary file handling
- Optional encryption for data at rest
- Clear data retention policies

## Disclosure Policy

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure principles:

1. **Private Notification**: Initial report kept confidential
2. **Coordinated Fix**: Work together on timeline and fix
3. **Public Disclosure**: After fix is available and deployed
4. **Credit**: Acknowledge reporter (if desired)

### Public Advisory

When we release security fixes, we will:

- Publish a security advisory on GitHub
- Include CVE identifier (if applicable)
- Describe the vulnerability and impact
- Credit the security researcher
- Provide upgrade instructions
- Recommend immediate update

## Security Contact

- **Email**: security@diffhe-physics.org
- **Response Time**: Within 24 hours
- **PGP Key**: Available on request
- **GitHub**: Use private vulnerability reporting

## Bug Bounty

We currently do not offer a formal bug bounty program, but we:

- Recognize security researchers in our Hall of Fame
- Provide early access to new features (if desired)
- Offer co-authorship opportunities for significant findings
- Send project swag and thank you notes
